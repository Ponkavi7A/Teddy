</p>
<br>
<p class="termpara2 font1"><b>Order Acceptance and Fulfillment  </b> </p>
<br>
<p class="termpara2 font1">The receipt of an order number or an email order confirmation does not constitute the acceptance of an order or confirmation of an agreement to sell. Teddy reserves the right, without prior notification, to limit the order quantity on any item and/or to refuse service to any customer. Verification of information may be required prior to the acceptance of an order. Prices and availability of products are subject to change without notice. Errors will be corrected when discovered and Teddy reserves the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any error, inaccuracy, or omission (including after an order has been submitted). Certain orders constitute improper use of the Site. Teddy reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to refuse or cancel any order for any reason. Your Teddy account may also be restricted or terminated for any reason, at Teddy's sole discretion.  We shall not be liable to you or to any third-party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Teddy Services.  We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the sales of our products or Teddy Services to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or Teddy Services that we offer. We reserve the right to limit or prohibit orders that, in our sole judgment, appear to be placed by dealers, resellers or distributors.

<br><br>You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase and account information for all purchases made at our Site. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including your email address and credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you as needed. For information on returns, please review our Returns Policy.</p>
  <br>
  <p class="termpara2 font1"><b>Shipping, Delivery and Risk of Loss </b> </p>
  <br>
  <p class="termpara2 font1">All items purchased from Teddy are made pursuant to a shipment contract with a shipping carrier. Teddy does not guarantee shipping or delivery times and is not liable for the actions or conduct of our shipping carriers. A delayed delivery of any part of an order does not entitle you to cancel other deliveries.  Risk of loss and title for products ordered from Teddy pass to you upon delivery of the products to the carrier. Products will be shipped to the address designated by you provided the address is complete and complies with any shipping restrictions contained on the Site. The time and location of delivery of the products to you is at the discretion of the carrier.
<br>
<p class="termpara2 font1"><b>Product Descriptions </b></p>
<br>
<p class="termpara2 font1">Teddy attempts to be as accurate as possible in describing the products on the Site. However, Teddy does not warrant that product descriptions, depictions, colors, dimensions, or other content on the Site are accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free. If a product offered by Teddy is not as described, your sole remedy is to return the product. </p>
</p>
<br>
<p class="termpara2 font1"><b>Reviews, Comments, Communications and Other User Content</b></p>
<p class="termpara2 font1">You may post reviews, comments, photos, videos, and other content on our Site on through social media, send e-cards and other communications, and submit suggestions, ideas, comments, questions, or other information, or enter contests or promotions; so long as the content is not illegal, obscene, threatening, defamatory, invasive of privacy, infringing of intellectual property rights (including publicity rights), or otherwise injurious to third parties or objectionable, and does not consist of or contain software viruses, political campaigning, commercial solicitation, chain letters, mass mailings, or any form of "spam" or unsolicited commercial electronic messages. You may not use a false e-mail address, impersonate any person or entity, or otherwise mislead as to the origin of a card or other content. Teddy reserves the right (but not the obligation) to remove or edit such content, but does not regularly review posted content.  You may not state or imply that the content is in any way provided, sponsored, or endorsed by Teddy. Because you alone are responsible for your content, you may expose yourself to liability if, for example, your content violates the Terms of Use policy. Teddy is not obligated to backup any your content, makes no representation that it will do so, and you agree that Teddy may delete your content at any time.
<br> <br>If you do post content or submit material, and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant Teddy a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant Teddy and sublicensees the right to use the name that you submit in connection with such content, if we choose. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post, that the content is accurate, that use of the content you supply does not violate the Terms of Use and will not cause injury to any person or entity, and that you will indemnify Teddy for all claims resulting from content you supply. Teddy has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. Teddy takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.  You agree to irrevocably waive (and cause to be waived) any claims and assertions of publicity or moral rights, or attribution with respect to your user content.  Because we do not control content which users provide through reviews, comments, and other communications, you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for any such content and we make no guarantees regarding the accuracy, currency, suitability, or quality of any such content, and we assume no responsibility for any such content. Your interactions with other Site users are solely between you and such user. You agree that Teddy will not be responsible for any loss or damage incurred as the result of any such interactions. If there is a dispute between you and any Site user, we are under no obligation to become involved.
<br> <br>
Teddy will treat any feedback, communications, or suggestions you provide to Teddy as non-confidential and non-proprietary subject to the limits of applicable law and our Privacy Notice. You agree that you will not submit to Teddy any information or ideas that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
